## Complex seasonality
So far, we have considered relatively simple seasonal pattern such as quarterly and monthly data. However, higher frequency time series often exhibit more
complicated seasonal patterns. For example, daily data may have a weekly pattern as well as an annual pattern. Hourly data usually has three types of seasonality:
a daily pattern, a weekly pattern, and an annual pattern.

Such multiple seasonal patterns are becoming more common with high frequency data recording. Further examples where multiple where multiple seasonal patterns can
occur include call volume in call centers, daily hospital admissions, requests for cash at ATMs, electricity and water usage, and access to computer websites.
