## Time Series Regression Models

The basic concept is that we forecast the time series of interest y assuming that it has a linear relationship with other time series x.

The *forecast variable* y is sometimes also called the regressand, dependent or explained variable. The *predictor variables* x are sometimes also called the
regressors, independent or explanatory variables.
