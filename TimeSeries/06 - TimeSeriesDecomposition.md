## Time Series Decomposition
Time series data can exhibit a variety of pattern, and it is helpful to split a time series in several components, each representing an underlying pattern.

When we combine a time series into components, we usually combine trend and cycle into a single trend-cycle compoenent sometimes called the trend for simplicity.
Thus, we think of a time series as comprising three components: a trend-cycle component, a seasonal component, and a remainder component containing anything else
in the time series.
