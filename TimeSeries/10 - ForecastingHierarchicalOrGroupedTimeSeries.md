## Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series
Time series can often be naturally dissaggregated by various attributes of interest. For example, the total number of bicycles sold by a cycling manufacturer
can be disaggregated by product type such as road bikes, mountain bikes, children's bikes and hybrids. Each of these can be disaggregated into finer categories.
For example, hybrid bikes can be divided into city, commuting, comfort, and trekking bikes. These categories are nested within the larger group categories and
so collection of time series follow a hierarchical aggregation structure. Therefore, we refer to these as "hierarchical time series".
