## Simple forecasting methods

#### Average method
The forecasts of all future values are equal to the average (or "mean") of the historical data.
```
meanf(y, h)
# y contains the time series
# h is the forecast horizon
```
#### Na誰ve method
For na誰ve method, simply set all forecasts to be the value of the last observation. This method works remarkably well for many
economic and financial time series. Because a na誰ve forecast is optimal when data follow a random walk, these are also called
*random walk forecasts.*
```
naive(y, h)
rwf(y, h) # Equivalent alternative
```
#### Seasonal na誰ve method
A similar method is useful for highly seasonal data. In this case, set each forecast to be equal to the last observed value
from the same season of the year (eg., the same month of the previous year).
```
snaive(y, h)
```
