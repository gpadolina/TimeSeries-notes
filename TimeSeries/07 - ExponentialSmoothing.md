## Exponential Smoothing

Exponential smoothing was proposed in the late 1950s and has motivated some of the most successful forecasting methods. Forecasts produced using exponential smoothing
methods are weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. In other words, the more recent the
observation the higher the associated weight.

In the first part, we present the mechanics of the most important exponential smoothing methods and their application in forecasting time series with various
characteristics. In the second part, we present the statistical models that underlie exponential smoothing methods.
