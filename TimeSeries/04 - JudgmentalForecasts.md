## Judgemental Forecasts

Forecasting using judgement is common in practice. In many cases, judgmental forecasting is the only option, such as when there is a complete lack of
historical data, or when a new product is being launched, or when a new competitor enters the market, or during completely new and unique market
conditions.

There are situations where there are no historical precedents, data are incomplete, or only become avaiable after some delay. For example, central
banks include judgement when forecasting the current level of economic activity, a procedure known as nowcasting, as GDP is only available on a
quarterly basis. Research in this area has shown that the accuracy of judgmental forecasting improves when the forecaster has (i) important domain
knowledge, and (ii) more timely, up-to-date information.

It is important to recorgnize that judgmental forecasting is subjective and comes with limitations. However, implementing systematic and well-structured
approaches can confine these limitations and markedly improve forecast accuracy.

There are general setting in which judgmental forecasting is used: (i) there are no available data, so that statistical methods are not applicable and
judgmental forecasting is the only feasible approach; (ii) data are available, statistical forecasts are generated, and these are then adjusted using
judgement; and (iii) data are available and statistical and judgmental forecasts are generated independently and then combined. We should clarify that
when data are available, applying statistical methods is preferable and should always be used as a starting point. Statistical forecasts are generally
superior to generating forecasts using only judgement.

## Beware of limitations
Judgmental forecasts are subjective, and therefore do not come free of bias or limitations.

Judgmental forecasts can be inconsistent. Unlike statistical forecasts, which can be generated by the same mathematical formulas everytime, judgmental
forecasts depend heavily on human cognition, and are vulnerable to its limitations. Judgement can be clouded by personal or political agendas, where
targets and forecasts are not segregated. Even in cases where targets and forecasts are well segregated, judgement may be plagued by optimism or wishful
thinking. For example, it would be highly unlikely that a team working towards launching a new product would forecast its failure. As we will discuss
later, this optimism can be accentuated in a group meeting setting. "Beware of the enthusiasm of your marketing and sales colleagues."

Another undesirable property which is commonly seen in judgmental forecasting is the effect of anchoring. In this case, the subsequent forecasts tend
to converge or be close to an initial familiar reference point. Anchoring may lead to conservatism and undervaluing new and more current information,
and thereby create a systematic bias.

## Key principles
Using a systematic and well structured approach in judgmental forecasting helps to reduce the adverse effects of the limitations of judgmental forecasting,
some of which we listed in the previous section.
#### Set the forecasting task clearly and concisely
It is important that everyone be clear about what the task is. All definitions should be clear and comprehensive, avoiding ambiguous and vague expressions.
In the Delphi method that follows, it may sometimes be useful to conduct a preliminary round of information gathering before seeting the forecasting
task.
#### Implement a systematic approach
Forecast accuracy and consistency can be improved by using a systematic approach to judgmental forecasting involving checklists of categories of
information which are relevant to the forecasting task. For example, it is helpful to identify what information is important and how this information
is to be weighted. It is worthwhile to devote significant effore and resources to put together decision rules that will lead to the best possible
systematic approach.
#### Document and justify
Formalising and documenting the decision rules and assumptions implemented in the systematic approach can promote consistency, as the same rules can be
implemented repeatedly.
