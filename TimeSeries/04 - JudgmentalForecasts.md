## Judgemental Forecasts

Forecasting using judgement is common in practice. In many cases, judgmental forecasting is the only option, such as when there is a complete lack of
historical data, or when a new product is being launched, or when a new competitor enters the market, or during completely new and unique market
conditions.

There are situations where there are no historical precedents, data are incomplete, or only become avaiable after some delay.
