## Judgemental Forecasts

Forecasting using judgement is common in practice. In many cases, judgmental forecasting is the only option, such as when there is a complete lack of
historical data, or when a new product is being launched, or when a new competitor enters the market, or during completely new and unique market
conditions.

There are situations where there are no historical precedents, data are incomplete, or only become avaiable after some delay. For example, central
banks include judgement when forecasting the current level of economic activity, a procedure known as nowcasting, as GDP is only available on a
quarterly basis. Research in this area has shown that the accuracy of judgmental forecasting improves when the forecaster has (i) important domain
knowledge, and (ii) more timely, up-to-date information.

It is important to recorgnize that judgmental forecasting is subjective and comes with limitations.
