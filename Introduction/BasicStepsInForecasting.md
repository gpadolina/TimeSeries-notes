## Basic steps in a forecasting task

#### 1. Problem definition
Often this is the most difficult part of forecasting. Defining the problem carefully requires an understanding of the
way the forecasts will be used, who required the forecasts, and how the forecasting function fits within the
organization requiring the forecasts. A forecaster needs to spend time talking to everytone who will be involved in
collecting data, maintaining databases, and using the forecasts for future planning.
#### 2. Gathering information
There are always at least two kinds of information required. a) statistical data, and b) the accumulated expertise of the
people who collect the data and use the forecasts. Often, it will be difficult to obtain enough historical data to be able
to fit a good statistical model. Good statistical models will handle evolutionary changes in the system; don't throw
away good data unnecessarily.
