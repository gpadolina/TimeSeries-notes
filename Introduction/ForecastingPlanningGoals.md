## Forecasting, planning, and goals

#### Forecasting
is about predicting the future as accurately as possible, given all of the information available, including historical data
and knowledge of any future events that might impact the forecasts.
#### Goals
are what you would like to happen. Goals should be linked to forecasts and plans.
#### Planning
is a response to forecasts and goals. Planning involve determining the appropriate actions that are required to make your
forecasts match your goals.
#### Short-term forecasts
are needed for scheduling. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.
#### Medium-term forecasts
are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy equipment.
